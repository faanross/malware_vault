# overview
**0001_shellcode_loader_text.cpp**
- simple shellcode loader in C
- good example of structure to ensure shellcode ends up in .text section of PE file
- uses VirtualAlloc(), RtlMoveMemory(), VirtualProtect(), and CreateThread() as core functions
- implemented custom function error_handler() for error handling + hardcoded breakpoint

**0002_shellcode_loader_data.cpp**
- same as 0001, but now will compile and place shellcode in .data
- achieved by simply moving declaration of shellcode array and length from inside main() (ie local) to outside of main (ie global)

**0003_shellcode_loader_rsrc.cpp**
- same basic idea as above but now our shellcode is not initialized in .cpp, instead in calc.ico (raw bytes)
- so raw byte shellcode saved as calc.ico
- there are also two additional files - resources.h and resources.rc required - included bottom of file
